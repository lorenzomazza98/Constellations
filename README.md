Classification of Constellations in Language C:

We want to develop a program for the classification of constellations.
It is supposed to observe a part of the sky in a certain instant of time (generation
random stars). The observation has dimensions nxm and a star can be
present (1) or absent (0).
The user enters a known constellation of dimensions cxr with c <n and r <m and
wants to look for the position of the constellation within the observation that
better represents it (better match).
The algorithm must return to the initial position from where the constellation begins with the
best match.
Carry out at least 5 tests, varying the star vault and the constellation entered by the user.
